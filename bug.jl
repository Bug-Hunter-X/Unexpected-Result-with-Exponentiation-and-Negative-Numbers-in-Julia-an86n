```julia
function myfunction(x)
  if x > 0
    return x^2
  else
    return -x^2 
  end
end

println(myfunction(2))  # Output: 4
println(myfunction(-2)) # Output: -4

#However, consider the following:
println(myfunction(0))
# Output: 0

#What's the bug?
#The bug lies in the use of the exponentiation operator `^` with negative numbers.
#In Julia, `-x^2` is parsed as `-(x^2)`, not `(-x)^2`.
#This means the negative sign is applied after the squaring operation.
#To correct this, we need to use parentheses to ensure the order of operations:
